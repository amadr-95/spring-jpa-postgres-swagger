# Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, PostgreSQL and Swagger example 
In this example we are going to build a Spring Boot Rest CRUD API with Maven that use Spring Data JPA/Hibernate to interact with PostgreSQL database.
Also, we are going to document the REST API with Swagger 3 annotations.  
  
We will build a Rest CRUD API for an Account application in that:
- Each Account has autogenerated _userId, name, username, password, email_, and _createdOn_ date, according this table:   
![model](src/main/resources/images/model.png)
- Apis provide CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete Accounts)
- Apis also support some custom finder methods such us find by name or by email domain

These are Apis that we provide:

| PUT     | /api/accounts/update/username/:id | update account username with :id                            |
| PUT     | /api/accounts/update/email/:id    | update account email with :id                               |
| DELETE  | /api/accounts/delete/:id          | delete an account by :id                                    |
